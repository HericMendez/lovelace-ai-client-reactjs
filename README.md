# Lovelace.ai - Front-end

## 1. Introduction

Lovelace is a virtual tutor prototype that utilizes Artificial Intelligence to assist in teaching mathematics. The project offers two main approaches:
- **Interactive chat with LangChain:** Responds to questions in real time.
- **Knowledge model with LangGraph:** Structures mathematical content in a graph format.

Developed with React on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end, Lovelace aims to make learning more dynamic and accessible.
